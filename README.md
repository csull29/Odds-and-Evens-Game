RULES OF MORRA - ODDS AND EVENS

Each player chooses either odds or evens at the beginning.
Both users then choose a number each between 0-10.
The sum of both players answers are calculated. 
If the sum of both numbers equals an odd number then TEAM ODDS WINS (and visa versa with TEAM EVENS) and earn a BONUS POINT.
The first player to reach 6 points wins!
